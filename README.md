> **‚ö†Ô∏è Linux Support Notice**
>
> A Linux version has been requested, but one is **not planned**. Pinny Notes is built using **WPF**, which is Windows-only. Even with a cross-platform framework, modern Linux desktops using **Wayland** do not allow applications to reliably set window positions or enforce ‚Äúalways on top‚Äù behavior, both of which are core features of Pinny Notes.
